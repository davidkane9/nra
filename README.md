Information Related to "Reduction in Firearm Injuries during NRA Annual Conventions"

This project is for use in my Ec 970 class at Harvard University.

This project includes data (kindly provided by Anupam Jena) related to Jena AB, Olenski AR. Reduction in firearm injuries during NRA annual conventions. N Engl J Med 2018;378:866-7. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMc1712773. [link](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1712773)

NRA conventions are 3 (sometimes 4) days long. Jena and Olenski compare gunshot injuries in the days of the convention each year against the same week-days during the weeks prior to and after the convention. For example, the 2015 convention was from April 10 (Friday) through April 12 (Sunday). There were 14 gunshot injuries during that 3 day period, compared to 20 (21) in the same Friday through Sunday 3 day period one week earlier (later).
