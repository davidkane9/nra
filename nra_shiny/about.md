## About

This project is intended to provide a tour of some of the data associated with Jena and Olenski (2018). In this project, we look at the methods and data of the paper to see whether we have similar results.

The Github repository is available [here](https://github.com/davidkane9/nra). Comments and questions can be directed to dkane@fas.harvard.edu.
